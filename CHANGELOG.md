## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-10

First tagged release. ac3forge is a clean-room AC-3 and E-AC-3 encoder and decoder in C++23,
implemented from the published standards — no FFmpeg or other codec library is linked, only
used during development as an independent oracle to check output against.

### AC-3 and E-AC-3 encoding

- Every AC-3 coding mode (1+1 dual mono, 1/0 through 3/2, each with or without LFE) at 48,
  44.1 and 32 kHz, CBR only, across all 19 nominal Table 5.18 bit rates. Exact 44.1 kHz timing
  via Bresenham alternation between the two legal frame lengths.
- E-AC-3, all of the above plus 7.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.4 and 7.1.4 through dependent substreams, and
  either CBR or VBR (a quality target with optional min/max kbps bounds) per substream.
- Per-block, per-channel block switching (§8.2.2 transient detector, long 512-point vs. switched
  256-point transform pairs), automatic delta bit allocation (§7.2.2.6), and 2/0 rematrixing
  (§7.5.3) on AC-3.
- Channel coupling (§7.4 / §E3.3), spectral extension (§E3.6) and the adaptive hybrid transform
  with gain-adaptive quantization (§E3.4) on E-AC-3, each opt-in per stream.
- `fscod2`, Annex E's half sample rates (24, 22.05, 16 kHz).

### Dolby Atmos objects (Joint Object Coding)

- Mono sources placed and moved in 3D space, panned into a 5.1 bed with OAMD + JOC metadata
  carried in an EMDF container (ETSI TS 103 420) — playable as plain 5.1 by any decoder, and
  reconstructible as discrete objects by one that understands the container.
- Authored keyframe paths and closed-form orbits for object motion, both file-driven
  (`ac3cli atmos-path`) and live per-frame (`ac3cli live --atmos`).
- Syntax checked field-for-field against Dolby's own Reference Player and Dolby Media Encoder.

### Decoding

- A single in-repo decoder core shared with the encoder, reading both AC-3 and E-AC-3 —
  dependent substreams, `chanmap`, and the §E3.8.2 render — at float32-precision parity with
  FFmpeg on every layout FFmpeg itself can read.
- All three Annex E coding tools (coupling, spectral extension, AHT) decode individually or all
  stacked together, at every channel layout including 7.1.4 — the one combination FFmpeg cannot
  check at all, since its parser refuses a second dependent substream.
- Block switching and dual mono decode on both formats; decoded switch decisions are reported
  back (`DecodedFrame::blksw`), the same tier of diagnostic as `dynrng`.

### Metadata

- `dynrng` (five DRC profiles: film-standard, film-light, music-standard, music-light, speech),
  `compr` heavy compression, measured `dialnorm` (ITU-R BS.1770-4 gated loudness), and downmix
  levels (`cmixlev`/`surmixlev`, the E-AC-3 `mixmdate` group) — verified against FFmpeg applying
  the metadata, not just against the encoded bits.

### Live audio, capture and passthrough

- WASAPI (Windows) and ALSA (Linux) backends for live input/loopback capture, shared-mode
  monitor playback, and exclusive-mode S/PDIF (IEC 61937) bitstream passthrough — AC-3 and
  E-AC-3/Atmos alike.
- A lock-free SPSC ring carries samples from capture into the encoder; `ac3cli live` wires
  capture → encode → monitor/passthrough continuously.
- `MonitorSink` playback confirmed against real Windows hardware, including a live
  microphone-capture-to-monitor session; ALSA verified headless (WSL2 has no sound devices) plus
  under AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer with leak detection.

### Tools and formats

- `ac3::io::scan`: derives stream format, access-unit boundaries and channel count directly from
  the bitstream.
- `matroska::matroska`: a standalone MKV muxer, independent of the codec library.
- `ac3::sinks::iec61937`: S/PDIF burst packing, byte-exact against FFmpeg's `spdif` muxer for
  AC-3 and independently verified against Microsoft's own IEC 61937 documentation for E-AC-3.
- `ac3::analysis`: peak/RMS/loudness metering with console ballistics and the Gerzon energy
  vector, shared by both front ends.
- `ac3cli`, a 21-command command-line front end, and `ac3gui`, a Qt Quick GUI with file and
  live-capture encoding, an object placement/motion view, and channel-level metering.

### Quality and packaging infrastructure

- CI across Windows (MSVC, clang-cl), Linux (GCC, Clang) and macOS (Homebrew LLVM) — CLI and GUI
  on Windows/Linux, CLI on macOS — plus a dedicated AddressSanitizer+UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
  leg, clang-tidy static analysis, a coverage gate, a per-platform gold-reference quality gate,
  and an independent FFmpeg-validation leg.
- libFuzzer harnesses over every untrusted-input entry point (stream scanning, both decoders,
  WAV reading), run on every push and nightly with deeper mutation.
- Signed, attested release packages (Windows `.zip`/`.exe`, Linux `.tar.gz`/`.deb`/`.rpm`, macOS
  `.tar.gz`/`.dmg`) with SHA-512 checksums, keyless Sigstore/OIDC build provenance, and an SPDX
  SBOM — see [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

### Known gaps

- Objects will not decode as *objects* in Dolby's own decoder: DD+ JOC gates that on an
  authenticity tag keyed to a secret embedded in Dolby's decoder binaries, which this project
  does not produce. The bed still decodes as plain 5.1 anywhere.
- Exclusive-mode S/PDIF/HDMI passthrough has not been confirmed against real bitstreaming
  hardware on either platform (no such endpoint was available during development).
- `fscod2` audio content has no external decode oracle at all, not even Dolby's own Reference
  Player — verified only by this project's own encoder/decoder round trip.

verified, and [docs/project/history.md](docs/project/history.md) for how this was built.
