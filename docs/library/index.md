# Using ac3::forge

The public API is the headers under `src/lib/include/ac3/`. Link `ac3::forge`; link
`matroska::matroska` as well if you want the container writer.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ac3::forge)
```

Every code block in this section is an excerpt from a program in
[`examples/`](../../examples/). Those are build targets and `ctest` entries, so a snippet that
stopped compiling would break the build rather than sit here being wrong.

## In this section

- [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md) — `ac3::FrameEncoder` and `EncoderConfig`.
- [Encoding E-AC-3](encoding-eac3.md) — `ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder` and wide layouts via `ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder`.
- [Decoding](decoding.md) — scanning a stream with `ac3::io::scan` and decoding it.
- [Spatial & Atmos objects](spatial-and-atmos.md) — the plain-AC-3 object layer and `ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`.
- [Metadata](metadata.md) — loudness, DRC and downmix metadata.
- [Muxing & sinks](muxing-and-sinks.md) — `matroska::mux`, the IEC 61937/passthrough/monitor sinks, and capture.
- [Header map](header-map.md) — every public header and what lives in it.

## Conventions

These hold across the whole API.

**Errors are `std::expected`.** Nothing throws for a stream-level or configuration problem.
`FrameError` covers encoding, `DecodeError` decoding, `ScanError` scanning, `WavError` file
I/O, `MuxError` muxing. `DecodeError`, `ScanError`, `WavError` and `MuxError` each have a
`describe()` returning a `std::string_view`; `FrameError` does not.

**Audio is `float`, nominally in [-1, 1).** Internally the transform runs in `double`.

**Channels are passed as `std::span<const std::span<const float>>`.** The inner spans must
outlive the call. Build the outer vector once and refill the buffers underneath it — a fresh
vector of spans per frame is a pure waste.

**Channel order is A/52 Table 5.8, not WAV order.** That is `L, C, R, SL, SR` with LFE last,
against WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE's `FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR`. `ac3::io::ac3_layout_for` and
`ac3::io::wav_channel_order` give you the permutation both ways; use them rather than writing
it out again.

**Encoders are stateful and per-stream.** They carry MDCT overlap, the 44.1 kHz rate
accumulator, and the DRC and heavy-compression controllers, all of which smooth across frames.
One encoder per stream, fed in order.

**Each `encode_frame` call takes exactly `ac3::kSamplesPerFrame` (1536) samples per channel.**
Short-changing it is a programming error, not a runtime one.
