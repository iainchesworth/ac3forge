# Using ac3::forge

The public API is the headers under `src/lib/include/ac3/`. Link `ac3::forge`; link
`matroska::matroska` as well if you want the container writer.

**In-tree** (this repo `add_subdirectory`'d into a larger build, or as a git submodule):

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ac3::forge)
```

`ac3::forge` resolves to whichever of the static or shared build the enclosing project's
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` asks for.

**Installed package**, from an `ac3forge-dev-*` package (see
[docs/releasing.md](../releasing.md#what-gets-published)) or a local `cmake --install`:

```cmake
find_package(ac3forge REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ac3::forge_static)   # or ac3::forge_shared
```

An installed package has no ambient `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` default to resolve against, so it
exports both variants explicitly rather than a bare `ac3::forge` — pick the one you want.
Neither the package nor the codec itself has any dependency of its own to find: no
`find_dependency()` calls, no system or third-party library, static or shared.

Live audio — capture, monitor playback, IEC 61937 passthrough — is `ac3::audio`
(`src/audio/`), a separate target `ac3cli`/`ac3gui` link alongside `ac3::forge` for their own
live-audio commands. It is **not** part of the distributed package: it isn't installed, isn't
exported, and `find_package(ac3forge)` says nothing about it. A consumer wanting live capture
on their own platform provides their own audio I/O and feeds the resulting PCM to the codec API
below directly — `ac3::audio` exists to serve this project's own CLI/GUI, not as something a
third party is expected to link.

Every code block in this section is an excerpt from a program in
[`examples/`](../../examples/). Those are build targets and `ctest` entries, so a snippet that
stopped compiling would break the build rather than sit here being wrong.

## In this section

- [Encoding AC-3](encoding-ac3.md) — `ac3::FrameEncoder` and `EncoderConfig`.
- [Encoding E-AC-3](encoding-eac3.md) — `ac3::eac3::FrameEncoder` and wide layouts via `ac3::eac3::AccessUnitEncoder`.
- [Decoding](decoding.md) — scanning a stream with `ac3::io::scan` and decoding it.
- [Spatial & Atmos objects](spatial-and-atmos.md) — the plain-AC-3 object layer and `ac3::oba::AtmosEncoder`.
- [Channel plans & routing](channel-plans-and-routing.md) — custom channel selections and multi-source assignment.
- [Metadata](metadata.md) — loudness, DRC and downmix metadata.
- [Muxing & sinks](muxing-and-sinks.md) — `matroska::mux`, metering, the IEC 61937/passthrough/monitor sinks, and capture.
- [File I/O](file-io.md) — reading and writing WAV.
- [Object signing](signing.md) — `ac3::signing`, the EMDF protection tag.
- [Header map](header-map.md) — every public header and what lives in it.

## Conventions

These hold across the whole API.

**Errors are `std::expected`.** Nothing throws for a stream-level or configuration problem.
`FrameError` covers encoding, `DecodeError` decoding, `ScanError` scanning, `WavError` file
I/O, `MuxError` muxing. `DecodeError`, `ScanError`, `WavError` and `MuxError` each have a
`describe()` returning a `std::string_view`; `FrameError` does not.

**Audio is `float`, nominally in [-1, 1).** Internally the transform runs in `double`.

**Channels are passed as `std::span<const std::span<const float>>`.** The inner spans must
outlive the call. Build the outer vector once and refill the buffers underneath it — a fresh
vector of spans per frame is a pure waste.

**Channel order is A/52 Table 5.8, not WAV order.** That is `L, C, R, SL, SR` with LFE last,
against WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE's `FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR`. `ac3::io::ac3_layout_for` and
`ac3::io::wav_channel_order` give you the permutation both ways; use them rather than writing
it out again.

**Encoders are stateful and per-stream.** They carry MDCT overlap, the 44.1 kHz rate
accumulator, and the DRC and heavy-compression controllers, all of which smooth across frames.
One encoder per stream, fed in order.

**Each `encode_frame` call takes exactly `ac3::kSamplesPerFrame` (1536) samples per channel.**
Short-changing it is a programming error, not a runtime one.
